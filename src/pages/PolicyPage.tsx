            </p>

            <h2>Use of Information</h2>
            <p>
                Once we have your data, we use it in the most profitable way for us. This includes:
            </p>
            <ul>

                Our sole objective is to extract the maximum profit from your information, regardless of the cost to you.
            </p>

            <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
            <p>
                We share your data with a vast and obscure network of business partners, data brokers, advertisers,
                and any other entity willing to pay for this information. We do not care what they do with your data,
                as long as it benefits us. This may include, but is not limited to:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Using it for hyper-invasive targeted advertising.</li>
                <li>Selling it to authoritarian regimes seeking to monitor their citizens.</li>
                <li>Providing it to hackers or malicious entities for potential exploitation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Protection</h2>
            <p>
                We do absolutely nothing to protect your data. Data security is not our priority,
                and we take no measures to ensure your personal information is secure. In the event of a data breach,
                you might be notified, but do not expect us to do anything to remedy the situation.
            </p>

            <h2>Your Rights</h2>
            <p>
                By using our service, you waive all your data protection rights.
                You have no right to object to the collection, use, or resale of your data.
                We do not respect any right to be forgotten, and it is practically impossible to unsubscribe from our data collection practices.
            </p>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time, without notice, to maximize our profit. We will not inform you of changes,
                as it is your responsibility to regularly check this document to see how we have decided to exploit your data today.
            </p>

            <h2>Contact</h2>
            <p>
                We do not have a real support team to address your privacy concerns because we are not interested.
                If you have any questions or complaints, we will gladly ignore them.
